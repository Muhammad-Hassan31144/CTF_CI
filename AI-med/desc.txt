An intern accidentally deployed a machine learning model with inverted labels â€” spam is marked as safe, and safe messages are flagged as spam.
Youâ€™ve been given access to its output predictions, but not the training logic.
Weâ€™ve embedded one real spam message that was mistakenly labeled as non-spam. If you can spot it and submit the correct index, youâ€™ll earn the flag.

ðŸ§  Pro tip: Think like a model. Donâ€™t just guess â€” investigate the behavior, patterns, and language of spammy phrasing.
