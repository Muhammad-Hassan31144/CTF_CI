You’ve recovered this pixel art image from a suspicious USB drive labeled “BACKUP_DO_NOT_OPEN.gif” — totally not suspicious.
At first glance, it’s nothing but a grid of colored blocks...
But something feels off. The image only looks basic — some colors seem carefully chosen.
We suspect whoever created this encoded something in a subtle pattern… maybe even hidden in the color definitions themselves.

Tip: Don't just look at the pixels — check what they're made of.
